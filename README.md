# HANNAH_Blender

An adapted workflow for Blender 4.3 for tablet users and left handed people. (Also friendly for right handed people)\
**IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT YOU KNOW THE DEFAULT KEYMAP OF BLENDER AND ARE USED TO A PIE MENU WORKFLOW, THIS OVERHAUL IS NOT FOR BEGINNERS**

I have been using the [HEAVYPOLY_BLENDER](https://github.com/HEAVYPOLY/HEAVYPOLY_Blender) setup since 2020, mainly for accessiblity reasons as RSI developed in my right hand.\
In 2022 I have started out doing a few PRs to optimize it for later blender versions. Down the line I started deleting scripts inside it that I didn't use and may add many more in the future.

This overhaul may exist with your installed addons. This addon covers built in addons and does not rely on external ones to do certain operations.\
Change preferences accordingly, Built in addons should be covered. Externally installed ones are not.

The reason why I keep using this setup is because my right hand under the default keymapping of Blender, suffers from repetitive stress.
The goal is to keep this overhaul as easy of an experience from this to Vanilla as you can get.
